CONTINUING EDUCATION

Code Fellows, Ruby on Rails Dev Accelerator, Fall 2013
An 8 week intensive Ruby on Rails course with 4 hours of classroom study and 4+ hours of project work each day. I was one of 21 students selected from over 400, based on interviews, technical aptitude, and grit. In addition to Ruby and Rails, we also used TDD, BDD, Postgres, Travis CI, Heroku, Github, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, Capybara, minitest, and many others. Code Fellows alumni are trained to find resources and learn quickly.

PROJECTS

Professional Portfolio, a Rails 3 application, Oct 2013 - present
A Ruby on Rails website showcasing the various full stack web developer skills gained through CodeFellows. This Rails 3 application demonstrates my working knowledge of Ruby, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, and many gems.

Set up continuous integration through Travis CI for automated testing (with Minitest) and subsequent deployment to Heroku. Implemented Postgres for test, development, and production environments. Attention paid to code coverage thanks to both CodeCoverage and SimpleCov. Used and customized Twitter Bootstrap for site personalization. Configured NewRelic to monitor and ping site to keep live (and not sleeping according Heroku default).


The Unofficial Trakehner Database, a Rails 4 application, Oct 2013 - present
Collaborative pair project for Code Fellows Ruby on Rails bootcamp, with Nathaniel Barnes. A website for the Trakehner horse enthusiast, with emphasis for Trakehner breeders.

Used AWS for CNAME, DNS, and S3 hosting of the user uploadable horse images. Improved security concerns through use of Brakeman. Used Devise for authentication.  Pundit and Omniauth for authorization according to policies and roles. Kept gems current using Gemnasium. Added basic i18n support for German. Implemented tables using simple_form gem for simplicity and straightforwardness of page design. Added responsive design for improved mobile experience.

VOLUNTEER WORK
